In robotics, particularly when dealing with robot kinematics and control, 

qz and qr usually refer to specific configurations or representations of the robot's joint parameters.

qz and qr 

qz:Often denotes a zero position or a configuration where all joint angles are set to zero. It represents a home or resting position of the robot.
In the context of a robot with two joints, for example, 

qz=[0,0] would mean that both joints are aligned along their respective axes, typically pointing straight up or towards the robot's base frame.

qr:Generally represents a specific robot configuration or a desired set of joint angles for a particular task or goal. This configuration can be used to describe a target position or orientation for the end effector.
For example, 
qr=[0.2,0.3] might mean the first joint is at 0.2 radians and the second joint is at 0.3 radians.
Usage in Robotics
Forward Kinematics: Both qz and qr can be used as inputs to the forward kinematics function (fkine) to calculate the position of the end effector in the respective configurations.

Control: In trajectory planning or motion control, the robot might move from 
qz to qr, allowing the end effector to reach a target position while ensuring smooth motion.

Example
qz=[0,0]:

Joint angles are both at 0.
End effector is at a base or home position.

qr=[0.2,0.3]:

Joint angles are set to 0.2 radians and 0.3 radians.
This configuration would be used to compute the corresponding end effector position.
Conclusion
Understanding qz and qr is crucial for tasks such as trajectory planning, robot simulation, and implementing control strategies. They serve as reference points for defining and achieving desired positions in a robot's workspace.
